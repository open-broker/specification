An example of an event-flow between broker and service provider could look like this:

1. Broker sends an application created event
2. The service provider sends a processing delayed event indicating that the case will be processed manually.
3. The service provider the sends a loan offering or a rejection event.
4. The customer sends an offer accepted event, indicating that the customer would like to sign for the offered loan.
4. The service provider sends a status updated event indicating that the customer has signed the documents
5. The service provider sends a loan disbursed event indicating that the loan has been disbursed.
6. [END]

Alternate flows:

Service provider denies the application:

- 3.a. A rejection event is sent in response to the application
- 3.b. [END]

Customer rejects the service provider's offer.

- 4.a. The broker sends an offer rejected event
